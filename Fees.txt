Respected Sir,
I ,KINGSHUK MONDAL, roll no.-12000119121,branch-COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING is facing issues about payment of college fees.I paid the college fees
on 27.07.2020. However upon confirming the payment from the college personels,I came to know that,they didn't recieve any payment from my side. 
They adviced me to arise a dispute in my bank.I did the same as adviced on 04.08.2020.The bank officers assured of revoking the payment with in ten days.
I am sorry to say that ,paying the fees within the deadline i.e 10.08.2020 is not possible for me.I hope for cooperation from your side.
Thank you.
Your's sincerely
KINGSHUK MONDAL
